In business, cryptic people won’t lay their cards down on the table. They’re operating under a false assumption: that your time is less valuable than theirs. Many cryptic people like to withhold information to get you coming after them—on their chain. When you spot this early on, proceed with caution.

Get them to give you some information early on. Negotiations go swimmingly if both parties feel as though they’re being treated fairly. If they’re unwilling to do that, it’s more than likely they’re not worth your time.

Kindly and directly ask them to reveal enough information to make a decision. Once the essentials are met: budget, timeline, scope—you can quickly move forward, or if they haven’t revealed anything—quickly drop the interaction. Use cryptic communication as a proxy for whom you don’t want to engage with.
