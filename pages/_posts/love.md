On this Valentine’s Day, no need to think of it as a day just for lovers—rather, think of it as a day to be grateful for the ones you love. It is a platitude but love truly is what matters most. Love helps us transcend. It helps us connect. When we start filling our hearts with love, we learn to see it everywhere. When we decide to love our family, friends, lovers, acquaintances, strangers, and enemies—we are filled with bliss and can rest in happiness.
